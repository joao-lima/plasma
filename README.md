PLASMA is a software package for solving problems in dense linear algebra
using multicore processors and Xeon Phi coprocessors.
PLASMA provides implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms
using cutting-edge task scheduling.
PLASMA offers routines for solving linear systems of equations,
linear least squares problems, singular value problems, eigenvalue
problems, routines for computing an inverse of a matrix,
PLASMA currently offers a collection of routines
for solving linear systems of equations, least square problems,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

PLASMA is in the process of porting form [QUARK](icl.cs.utk.edu/quark/)
to [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/).
At the same time, it is moved from its ICL SVN repository
to this Bitbucket Mercurial repository.
The content of this repository reflects the progress of the transition.
Before the transition is complete, the old releases of PLASMA are available at
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/.

PLASMA is a dense linear algebra package at the forefront of multicore computing.
PLASMA is designed to deliver the highest possible performance from a system with
multiple sockets of multicore processors. PLASMA achieves this objective
by combining state of the art solutions in parallel algorithms, scheduling,
and software engineering. PLASMA currently offers a collection of routines
for solving linear systems of equations, least square problems, eigenvalue problems,
and singular value problems.

PLASMA is currently in the process of moving from SVN hosted by ICL to Mercurial
hosted by Bitbucket, while being ported from [QUARK](icl.cs.utk.edu/quark/) to OpenMP.
This is the new Bitbucket repository of PLASMA, where you can track the progress
of the transition. Before the transition is complete, you can get the PLASMA
software from its ICL hosted SVN repository: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/.

PLASMA is a dense linear algebra package at the forefront of multicore computing.
PLASMA is designed to deliver the highest possible performance from a system with
multiple sockets of multicore processors. PLASMA achieves this objective
by combining state of the art solutions in parallel algorithms, scheduling,
and software engineering. PLASMA currently offers a collection of routines
for solving linear systems of equations, least square problems, eigenvalue problems,
and singular value problems.
